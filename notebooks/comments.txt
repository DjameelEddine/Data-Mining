- We can use PCA for numerical columns, visualize the 2D data points we get
in order to identify clusters.
- Apply K-means and DBScan clustering algorithms, that may give us
insights about packages, anomaly detection.
- Both datasets can be treated separately, we see receptacles' journey alone
and packages' journey alone, we may need to merge later to extract information
related to packages of the same receptacle, etc.
- a target feature `delay` in minutes (or hours) may be added for each row
in both datasets and we can use it to predict delays.
- We may propose later also classification tasks using `issue_happened` where
delay is greater than a specific threshold
- some inconsistencies between current and next etablissement postal still exist

- Packages dataset has `date` values between 2020-2025
- receptacle has between 2022-2025
- `MAILITM_FID` is duplicated in packages dataset
- visualized distribution of features in our case can only 
be used for imputation (null values handling)
- higher traffic between two establishements doesn't
necessarily imply majorness of distribution centers
(it could be the only center in a big traffic route).
- most frequent routes may help us decide lost or
packets/receptacles facing issues during transfer
(like the most active routes are more likely to have issues).
- same for most active centers.
- number of packages per receptacle why needed to merge?
(could be extracted from packages dataset directly)
- null values and data inconsistencies (packages having
a non-existent receptacle IDs, Dates differences between
the two datasets, etc.) aren't handled!
